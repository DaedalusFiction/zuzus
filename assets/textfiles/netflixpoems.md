### The American Barbecue Showdown

Behold! The heartland offers forth
A spectacle of butcher'd meats,
A competition pits the North
Against her Souther sister's sweets.

Oh band of merry masters, true
To thine own selves and kinship be!
Cast off thy weakness, and subdue
The raging furnaces thou see.

Alas! I see the tender cuts
Absorbing hues of gilden wheat;
I hear the sizzling of the butts
That brave the smoker's awful heat.

Oh Circe! Get thee gone! For swine
With swine shall ever cast their lot,
And never sense th'aromas time
And screen have lock'd and giveth not.

### Queer Eye Season Six, Episode Three

Emerging from his sodden cave
The Man-Child shades his bleary eyes
And slowly strokes his jowl unshav'd
As in his den there stands The Five.

"Dear God," in unison they claim--
The Man-Child winces and retreats;
The Five disperse and lay reclaim
To beauty's realm his rugs and sheets.

Downtown The Five with him abscond
And trim his unctuous, unbrush'd locks
And to his wardrobe then respond
With friendly claps and playful gawks.

Behold! As from the Underworld
Like Heracles he stands redeem'd!
And to the stars his name is hurled
To rest, where fame's forever dream'd.
