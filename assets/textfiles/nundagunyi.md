“Thank you for joining us, Mister Shilling.”

Wade Shilling lifted his head and watched with sharkish eyes the two suited men that had entered the room. He then shut his eyes and exhaled slowly through his nose as if preparing for meditation before jerking suddenly and violently his steel handcuffs into the steel back of his chair.

“Try to remain calm,” one of the men said with a dry, soothing voice. “Like you, we only want what is best.”

Wade studied them more closely now. Nearly everything about them was identical--they wore the same short-cropped haircuts, the same black suits with black ties, the same manicured fingernails, the same placid yet resolute expressions. In fact, there was only one discrepancy that Wade could find: the one to his left seemed to have platforms in his shoes, which elevated him to the level of his companion.

“Who are you?” asked Wade, slurring from the lingering effects of some kind of sedative. “Where am I? Why...am I here?”

“You can call me Mister Renner,” said the one who would have been shorter. “This is my associate. You can call him Mister Dogson.”

The faint scent of bleach permeated the small, white room. The tiled floor, though a little scuffed, was as clean as an operating room’s, while the thick, knobless steel door against the back wall, covered with all manner of dents and scratches, looked as though it might have been reclaimed from an old prison ward. And, except for Wade’s low breathing and the hum of the bright fluorescent tube lights overhead, the room was completely silent. Renner and Dogson sat down.

“Where am I?”

“We’ll get to that in a moment,” said Dogson. “I want to assure you that everything that is happening is completely normal. Please, try to remain calm.”
Renner and Dogson held their hands carefully positioned on the table in front of them, fingertips together and pointed at Wade. They smiled blandly, with their heads tilted slightly to the left to highlight their necks. Wade twisted in his chair and looked away.

“Tell us, if you can,” said Renner, “your first memory of the Coalition.”

Wade squinted, parted his mouth, and drew in a short breath. He then shut his mouth and stared ahead.

Renner and Dogson let out a short sigh. Renner turned his head and stared through the pristine mirror that covered the entire side wall. The three of them sat motionless until Renner and Dogson nodded and stood up simultaneously. They retreated into the corners of the room behind Wade as if drawn there magnetically. The steel door clanged and squealed open.

A short man with thin silver-blond hair appeared in the doorway. He wore a white lab coat over khakis and a burnished sapphire ring on his left pinky. His freckled, milky cheeks sagged a little like a young bulldog’s, and in his soft-looking, demure hands he carried a single unmarked manila folder.

“You’ll have to forgive my associates, Mister Shilling,” he said as he placed the folder squarely on the table. “We don’t get too many citizens around here, you see.”

Wade squinted.

“I suppose you do deserve a more detailed explanation,” he said as he sat down. “But if you will bear with me a moment, I promise that all will be made clear. My name is Merringer.” He offered his hand. “A pleasure to meet you.”

Wade clenched his jaw and looked away. Merringer, realizing his mistake, withdrew his hand to his lap and bowed his head apologetically.

“Yes, well,” continued Merringer, “down to business, as they say.” He turned open the folder to reveal a single sheet of glossy, black paper. “Let’s see what we have.”

Merringer slid a damp fingertip across the top of the sheet, which summoned up a simple number pad. He typed in a few short sequences, to which the sheet blinked brightly a few times, dimmed, and went again completely black. Merringer, with a sigh and shaking his head, repeated the entire process, this time more slowly and emphatically. “I hate these things,” he said.

The page blinked again, paused, and turned white with black text. “Ah, here we go,” he said, clearing his throat. “Wade Alfred Shilling, born December 7, 2163, to Drs. Derrick and Amanda Shilling of Portswine, Inner Haven. Forty-three years of age; five-foot-eleven; brown hair, brown eyes; no identifying scars or birthmarks. Occupation: courier. Hmm. Named after his grandfather, Wade Grant Shilling,” said Merringer. Then, looking up at Wade: “The revolutionary.” Merringer tapped on a box in the upper-left corner of the page, revealing more text. “It says here you were accepted to the Grayburn School of Applied Astrophysics at the age of seventeen.”

“And a half.”

“A prodigy, judging by your test scores. But you didn’t attend. Shame.”

“Is that why I’m here?”

“Oh, no, no. Far from it, actually. Let’s see, I have the document right...” Merringer continued swiping through page after page until at last he found the prize of his search. “Here we are: last month’s wellness evaluation. Question...forty-three. ‘If a man throws himself from a cliff, does he deserve to die?’”

Dogson or Renner sniffled.

“You left no answer. In the margin you typed, ‘that depends on the height of the cliff.’”

Wade shrugged.

“I suppose you think that’s rather clever, Mister Shilling,” said Merringer. “But, if you’ll take a moment to consider the implications of your response, you will, with a mind as sharp as yours, surely realize that this really is no trivial matter.”

“I know what I wrote.”

Merringer nodded. “You know what you wrote. Of course you do. But no one deserves to die, Mister Shilling, not for any reason, not ever.”

Wade tilted his head back and stared at the ceiling. He took a deep breath as Merringer waited for him to finish his thought. “Fine then,” said Wade, looking back down at Merringer. “A man who throws himself from a cliff doesn’t deserve to die. But he does deserve to hit the ground.”

Merringer smiled. “This isn’t a matter of semantics, Mister Shilling.”

“It’s a matter of cause and effect,” said Wade. “People deserve the consequences of their actions.”

“People,” said Merringer, gently rolling his delicate fingertips over the top of the steel table, “are not always responsible for their actions.”

“Then who is?”

The two sat under the hum of the lights above while Merringer continued to roll his fingertips, slowly at first, then gradually faster and faster until at last he sighed, sat upright, and straightened his coat. “I’d like to tell you a story.”

Wade shrugged his lips. “I’m not going anywhere.”

Merringer smiled, took in a slow, deep breath, and leaned back in his chair. “When I was a young boy,” he began, “my grandfather once told me about a young rice farmer and his family. Now, this farmer and his family lived on happily for many years, grateful for the fruits of the land, until, one year, there came a terrible famine. The emperor, in order to feed his grand armies, tripled the taxes on the rice the farmer produced, leaving the farmer with even less of his already dismal harvest.

“The farmer, seeing that he and his family could not survive the coming winter, fell in with a band of thieves. They began robbing the merchants and tax collectors that travelled the road, stealing rice and grain that was going to feed the armies. When he had gotten enough food to avoid starvation, he returned to his farm and lived on in peace.

“One day, in the following spring, the emperor’s guard showed up at the young farmer’s door. One of the other thieves had been caught and had given the farmer up. The farmer pleaded for his life, and promised to pay back every grain of rice tenfold, but it was no use. The emperor’s guard beheaded him and left his family to beg in the streets.”

“That’s awful,” said Wade.

“Tell me, then,” continued Merringer, “did our friend the young farmer deserve to die?”

Wade thought with a sullen face. “No,” he finally said.

“No? He knew the law, knew that thievery was punishable by death, and that if he stole he would die. Is this not cause and effect?”

“The emperor acted unjustly,” Wade said with a tensed jaw. “The punishment outweighed the crime.”

“Did it?” asked Merringer, raising his eyebrows. “Remember that that rice was to feed his armies. They need to eat as well.”

“They didn’t grow the rice,” said Wade. “The farmer did.”

“And they protect the farmer. They fend off the enemy at the gates so that the farmer can go on farming in peace. If the armies starve, if the armies die, then they all die. And if thieves are free to steal with impunity, then that is exactly what will happen.”

Wade sat perfectly still except for a slow nodding motion he made with his head. Merringer smiled with eager eyes but said nothing. Finally, Wade whispered:

“You don’t know that.”

“Precisely!” exclaimed Merringer. “Precisely!”

Wade frowned. “What do you mean?”

“I mean that there is a better way! I mean that...Did you know that there is enough rice in Inner Haven alone to meet the needs of the entire solar system for nine decades! Nine! Just with what we have, right now. And yet so many of our colonies are withering away. Now why do you think that is?”

Wade shook his head.

“It’s because we have developed too rapidly. The moral mind is the slowest and most guarded, and we’ve pushed it aside, walked on by as if it were...were a beggar in the streets! What good is stealing in a universe without scarcity? Yet these...citizens...they do it anyway. Don’t you see? We need to recalibrate, Mister Shilling.”

Wade twisted his handcuffs.

“What peace we enjoy is only as strong as we believe it to be,” said Merringer. “It exists in the minds of the faithful, in the minds of those who believe. And it only takes a shadow of a doubt to sweep away all that we have created, to undermine everything that we are straining towards. That is why we have these tests, you see. Why we have these questions.”

“I haven’t done anything wrong.”

Merringer closed his eyes and smiled. Suddenly he stood up and walked to the mirror, and stood in front of it with his hands folded behind his back, as if studying his own reflection. Then, without turning around, he said, “Do you know the origin of strawberries?”

“What?”

“Strawberries. Do you know where they come from?”

Wade stared at Merringer. “What the hell are strawberries?”

“Oh, right,” said Merringer, turning around and bowing his head. “A sweet fruit, historically eaten raw.”

“I thought raw foods were illegal.”

“They are. That’s why I say, ‘historically.’ Anyway, there was a fable told by the ancient Cherokees of Old America. According to their mythos, the first man and the first woman lived happily together--like the farmer and his family--as husband and wife, until, naturally, they began to quarrel. The man became angry with his wife, berating and insulting her, until one day she decided that she had had enough and set out to the East for Nundagunyi, the Land of the Sun.”

Merringer began pacing the room, his hands still behind his back except now and then when he used one to emphasize a point. “The man followed, grief-stricken, but the woman continued on without looking back. The Creator, who had given the woman to the man, took pity on them and asked the man if he was still angry with his wife. When the man said he was not, the Creator offered to return his wife to him, and the man gratefully and eagerly agreed.”

Wade sank further into his chair. “You like telling stories, don’t you?” he said. Merringer licked his thin lips and regarded his fingernails absentmindedly.

“So the Creator created, as creators do,” he continued, “a patch of the plumpest, juiciest huckleberries ever found on earth, and placed it ahead of the woman. But when the woman reached them, she walked by, unfazed. The Creator, seeing how determined she was, lined her path with scores of the darkest blackberries that had ever existed, but these too the woman ignored. The Creator tried again and again, with blueberries and peaches and limes, and apples red as fresh blood, but nothing could catch the woman’s eye.

“The woman kept on until she came across a bush filled with a fruit she had never seen before. She stopped to pick some, and as she did she happened to turn her head to the West. The memory of her loving husband filled her mind, and she was unable to continue on her journey.

“So she sat down, but the longer she sat, the more she longed for her husband’s embrace, until finally she could sit no longer. She gathered the largest and ripest of the odd berries, which she called strawberries, and travelled west until she met her husband, and the two returned home, where they were happy.”

“Until they started bickering again, you mean,” said Wade.

Merringer smiled. “Try to keep an open mind, Mister Shilling. Try to understand what it is I’m telling you.”

“I’ll keep an open mind when you start getting to the point.”

“Can you not see? Is it not clear? There is no causality, Mister Shilling! The woman didn’t stop and turn around because of the strawberries; it didn’t matter if they were blackberries or blueberries or any kind of berries! She simply changed her mind. Because she wanted to, and for no reason other than she wanted to.”

“I don’t understand.”

“I’m not asking you to understand, Mister Shilling. I’m asking you to believe. In me. In us. In the irreproachable, unassailable value of human life.”
Wade began to grind his teeth.

“We value life,” said Merringer. “We value it above all else, because it is only by holding life as the pinnacle of worth and importance that we can achieve this peace.” Merringer returned to the table and closed the folder, not looking at Wade. “You’ve had your fill of strawberries, Mister Shilling. And now it’s time for you to decide whether you will return home.”

Wade bit his lower lip and shook his head. He looked around the room, at the mirror, at the steel door, at the lights above him. He then lowered his head, so that his chin nearly touched his chest, and made several half-shakes of his head. Finally he said, "I need time. I need...I need to think about this."

Merringer pinched the bridge of his nose and shut his eyes as though he suffered a mild headache. He exhaled sharply through his nose. “You are a relic, do you know that? A monolith of a defunct and derelict mentality. You recoil into that mentality as a turtle recoils into its shell.”

“You know, the thing about turtles,” said Wade. “They live an awful long time.”

“Not the ones in the middle of the road.”
Merringer stood up. In an instant Renner and Dogson flanked Wade.

“Wait, wait, hold on,” said Wade. “Let’s talk, okay? Let’s talk.”

“That time has come and gone,” said Merringer, picking up the manila folder. “Don’t be afraid, Mister Shilling. It won’t be much longer.”

“Much longer? What do you...”

Merringer looked again into his reflection. “You can send him, now.”

Wade strained again at his handcuffs and turned to look at Renner and at Dogson. “Send me? Send me where?”

The steel door creaked open as Renner pulled a thin fiber wire from his pocket. Merringer took a step forward and stopped in the threshold. “To Nundagunyi,” he said. “To the Land of the Sun.”
